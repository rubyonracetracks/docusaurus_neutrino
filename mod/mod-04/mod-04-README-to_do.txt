GETTING STARTED
1.  Enter the command "bash build.sh; bash server.sh".
2.  Open your web browser to the appropriate URL to view your app locally.
3.  Start a second terminal tab for entering additional commands.
4.  Start a GitHub repository for your new app, and push your new app into that repository.
5.  Deploy this app.  Instructions on doing this are at https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/publishing.  (NOTE: The Netlify way is easier.)
6.  Go to Travis CI at https://travis-ci.com/ and add a continuous integration badge for the build.  Docusaurus Neutrino provided the .travis.yml file for you.
7.  Go to Dependabot (https://dependabot.com/) and track this app.  Dependabot automatically sends pull requests of recommended updates.
8.  Remove the sidebar on the right hand side of the first documentation page.  In the website/siteConfig.js file, delete the line "onPageNav: 'separate'" (and the comment above).
9.  OPTIONAL: Enable the search engine in this app.  More details are provided at https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/search.html.
10.  Customize the README.md file and everything else in this app.  View, test, update, and deploy it frequently.
